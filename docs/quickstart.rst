Quick Start
===========

This guide will help you get started with JAX-HDC quickly.

Basic Usage
-----------

.. code-block:: python

   import jax_hdc

   # Example code will be added here once the library structure is established

Key Concepts
------------

Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HDC is a computational framework that uses high-dimensional vectors to represent
and manipulate information. Key concepts include:

* **Hypervectors**: High-dimensional vectors (typically 1000+ dimensions)
* **Binding**: Combining two hypervectors
* **Bundling**: Superposition of multiple hypervectors
* **Similarity**: Measuring distances between hypervectors

JAX Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

JAX-HDC leverages JAX's capabilities for:

* **JIT compilation**: Fast execution of HDC operations
* **Vectorization**: Efficient batch processing
* **Automatic differentiation**: Gradient-based optimization
* **Hardware acceleration**: GPU/TPU support
